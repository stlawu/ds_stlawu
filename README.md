### Accessible Breadcrumbs

Bootstrap 4 has improved upon [breadcrumb
accessibility](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/breadcrumb/), but
the base theme Bootstrap does not currently support Bootstrap 4. This sub-theme
modifies the markup for the breadcrumbs so that the ordered list is wrapped in a
`<nav>` tag to signify to screenreaders that the list of breadcrumbs is
navigation and also applies `aria-current="page"` to the current page's location
within the breadcrumb navigation hierarchy.

### Better Figure and Figcaptions for inline images and media

As per the markup recommendations in [How do you
figure?](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/21/how-do-you-figure.html), this
sub-theme uses `figure="role"` on `figure` elements. Similar is applied to media
types.

### Twig `block`, `extends`, and `parent()`

Many of the templates in this sub-theme take advantage of
[`block`](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/block.html),
[`extends`](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/tags/extends.html), and
[`parent()`](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/functions/parent.html).

### Cleaner `.theme` file

This sub-theme takes advantage of the base theme's [plugin
system](https://drupal-bootstrap.org/api/bootstrap/docs%21plugins%21README.md/group/plugins/8.x-3.x)
for preprocessing variables for templates.
